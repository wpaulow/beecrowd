# beecrowd

## What it is

- A repository of solutions for Beecrowd platform problems in four programming languages: C, Java, Python, and TypeScript.

## Objective

- To encourage the resumption of solving and sharing solutions, aiming to improve algorithm writing in different languages, observing best practices and the best resources of each language, always targeting optimization and performance;

## Secondary Objective

- To perform benchmarking between solutions using shell scripts for comparisons between languages and between different versions within the same language, as well as similar versions in different languages;

## How it works

## Prerequisites

- You must have Python 3 (3.12.3 here), Java JDK 21, a C compiler of your choice, Node (v22.16.0), and TSC (5.8.3) installed, respectively;
